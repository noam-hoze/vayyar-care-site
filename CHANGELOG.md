## 0.1.1 - 2025-08-12

Status: In progress (mobile Apple-style top section)

Changes:
- Mobile-only Narrow Text section added and styled per spec (centered, bold, double spacing).
- Mobile scrolly video (right below narrow text) now renders as simple 16:9 without sticky or overlay text.
- Kept product scrollâ€‘scrub video behavior intact on mobile and desktop.

Remaining:
- Tune font sizes and spacing to precisely match Apple reference across common mobile widths.
- Implement mobile-only component color/typography pass for Part 3 titles/content (`#1D1D1F` / `#86868B`) where not already applied.
- Confirm order and content parity with `MOBILE_CONTENT_MOCKUP.md` for all sections (AI insights, Privacy, Personalized Care).
- Add automated visual regression for mobile breakpoints for the top section.
