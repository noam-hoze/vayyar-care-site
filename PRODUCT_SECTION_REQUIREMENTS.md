# Product Section Requirements (ID: 1.5)

This document outlines the requirements for the product display section, inspired by the Apple Vision Pro product page.

## Visual Components

1.  **Logo:**

    -   A logo should be displayed at the top of the section. The user did not specify which logo, but `Vayyar Care` logo seems appropriate.

2.  **Product Image:**

    -   The main product image, located at `public/images/product.png`, should be prominently displayed in the center of the section.

3.  **"Take a closer look" Button:**
    -   Below the product image, there should be a button with the text "+ Take a closer look".
    -   This button should be styled similarly to the reference image (Apple's design).

## Interaction

-   The "Take a closer look" button will likely trigger an animation or a transition to a more detailed view of the product. This will be defined in a later stage.
