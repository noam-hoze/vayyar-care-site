## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (version compatible with Next.js 15, check Next.js docs)
-   pnpm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd vayyar-care-mockup
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    _(Note: If you encounter issues, try the `pnpm run reinstall` script after pruning the pnpm store if necessary)._

### Running the Development Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Building for Production

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Starting the Production Server

```bash
pnpm run start
```

## Available Scripts

In addition to the standard Next.js scripts (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`), the following custom scripts are available:

-   `pnpm run reinstall`: Cleans the `node_modules` directory and pnpm store, then reinstalls dependencies. Useful for resolving dependency issues.
-   `pnpm run upload-videos`: Executes the `tools/upload_videos_to_firebase.js` script to upload video assets to Firebase Storage. Configuration for Firebase credentials might be required.

### Helper Scripts (`tools/`)

These scripts are located in the `tools/` directory and are used for asset preparation, likely before running `upload-videos`:

-   `convert_mov_to_mp4.sh`: Converts `.mov` video files to `.mp4` format using `ffmpeg`.
-   `make_scrubbable.sh`: Processes video files (likely MP4) to ensure they are easily scrubbable in web video players, possibly by adjusting keyframes or using `ffmpeg`.

Make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed and configured in your environment if you need to use these shell scripts.

### Video chunking
`ffmpeg -i output_vid.mp4 -f segment -segment_time 30 -c:v copy -c:a copy -reset_timestamps 1 -map 0 output-%02d.mp4`
